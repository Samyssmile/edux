/**
 * Provides the classes necessary to define various activation functions used in neural networks.
 *
 * <p>This package is part of the larger Edux framework for educational purposes in the realm of machine learning.
 * Within this package, you will find enumerations and possibly classes that represent a variety of standard
 * activation functions, such as Sigmoid, TanH, ReLU, and others. These functions are fundamental components
 * in the construction of neural networks, as they dictate how signals are processed as they pass from one
 * neuron (or node) to the next, essentially determining the output of each neuron.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each activation function contained within this package has distinct characteristics and is useful in
 * different scenarios, depending on the nature of the input data, the specific architecture of the network,
 * and the learning task at hand. For instance, some functions are better suited for dealing with issues like
 * the vanishing gradient problem, while others might normalize input values into a certain range to aid with
 * the convergence of the learning algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <p>This package is designed to offer flexibility and ease of use for those constructing machine learning
 * models, as it allows for easy switching between different activation strategies, facilitating experimentation
 * and learning.</p>
