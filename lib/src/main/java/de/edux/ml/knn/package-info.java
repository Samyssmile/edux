/**
 * Provides the classes necessary for implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in
 * machine learning. This package includes the core algorithm implementation, data processing
 * utilities, and various distance metrics used in the KNN algorithm.
 *
 * <p>The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning,
 * where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until
 * classification. It is widely used for classification and regression predictive problems in
 * machine learning. The simplicity of the algorithm and its effectiveness in a wide range of
 * problem settings make it a popular choice.
