/**
 * Core functionalities for image augmentation in the Edux framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the central components and utilities used for image augmentation
 * processes. It includes classes and interfaces for image transformation, manipulation, and the
 * application of various augmentation techniques. The core package serves as the foundation for
 * building more complex image augmentation pipelines and is designed to be extensible to
 * accommodate new types of augmentations and image processing operations.
 *
 * <p>Key components include interfaces for defining augmentation operations, classes for managing
 * image data and transformations, and utility classes that provide common functionalities needed
 * across different parts of the image augmentation process. This package is intended to work in
 * conjunction with other packages in the Edux framework, particularly those handling image
 * input/output operations and integration with machine learning models.
